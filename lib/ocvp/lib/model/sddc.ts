* A software-defined data center (SDDC) contains the resources required for a

* and deploy VMware virtual machines (VMs) in the SDDC.
* <p>
The SDDC uses a single management subnet for provisioning the SDDC. It also uses a
* set of VLANs for various components of the VMware environment (vSphere, vMotion,
* vSAN, and so on). See the Core Services API for information about VCN subnets and VLANs.
